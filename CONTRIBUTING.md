## Coding conventions

These are the conventions that you should follow when contributing to the repository. Some of them will be checked automatically during a pull request. Following these conventions will make code reviews much easier.

### Docstrings and type hints

We use the [Google docstring format](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html) without type hints in the string, since they will we added in the function header according to [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). 
**Example:**

```python
def multiply_by_2(x : int) -> int:
    """
    This function multiplies a number by 2.
    
    Args:
        x: Parameter description
    Returns:
        The product x * 2
    """
    
    return x * 2

class MyClass:
    """
    This class just contains two numbers.

    Attributes:
        attribute_1 (int): Description of Attribute 1
        attribute_2 (float): Description of Attribute 2

    Args:
        i: First parameter of the init
        x: Second parameter
    """
    
    def __init__(self, i : int, x : float = 3.14) -> None:
        # Comments starting with "#" are not docstrings
        # It's also possible to have a docstring with "Args"
        # in the init instead of the class docstring, but 
        # you should only do one of both.
        self.attribute_1 = i
        self.attribute_2 = x

# Special case: Union type format in PEP 604
def add(a : int | float, b : int | float) ->  int | float:
    """
    This function adds two numbers
    
    Args:
        a: A number
        b: Another number
    
    Returns:
        The sum of both numbers
    """
    return a + b

# None as default value requires a Union type
def optional(s : str | None = None) -> None:
    """
    This function prints a string

    Args:
        s: A string to be printed
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    print(s if s is not None else "No input provided")
    
```

The following docstring currently produces a bug in sphinx:

```python
class MyClass:
    """
    Docstring
 
    Attributes:
        attribute_1: Description of Attribute 1
        attribute_2: Description of Attribute 2
    """
    attribute_1: int
    attribute_2: float
```
Therefore, please don't use type annotations for class attributes, instead write them into the docstring. We will try to fix this.

### Formatting

We use `black` (with line-length 119) and `isort` (black profile) as automated formatters. On pull requests, this is automatically checked and you can only merge if your code passes the check. You can include both in a 
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) locally by executing `mamba install pre-commit` and `pre-commit install`, which creates a hook in your local git repository that is called when a commit is executed. 
This will work assuming you have `black` and `isort` installed in your environment. `pre-commit` takes information from the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to know which actions to perform. The formatting rules for both tools are defined in `pyproject.toml`.

**Note:** We may decide on slight variations in the code formatting. This will be mentioned here in the future.
